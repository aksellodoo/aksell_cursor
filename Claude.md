Always remember to run the preview locally.
If you need to connect to supabase, search the project for supabase information and use Supabase CLI . Also use the credentials of supabase on this project. Also if you need the token is sbp_5cf553b4fa254419f4738c57b476d9a70a7c0189 You can use this to deploy edge functions and do other things with supabase.
After you complete a task from the project plan, update the projectplan.md file so that we can track progress and changes. Tick off any items that have been completed. Remember to put the date and time of the changes.
After you made all the changes, at last, ask the user if the user wants to commit the change to the github repository. If he agrees, then commit the project to github, so it updates the github.
Update the preview on every change you make to the app and project. Remember to mantain the last preview config if preview was already working.
