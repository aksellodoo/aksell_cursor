Always remember to run the preview locally and to update the preview on every change you make to the app and project.
When you complete a task from the project plan, update the projectplan.md file so that we can track progress and changes. Tick off any items that have been completed.
After you made all the changes, at last, ask the user if the user wants to commit the change to the github repository. If he agrees, then commit the project to github, so it updates the github.
